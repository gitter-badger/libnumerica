*v0.1.0-alpha*



Build status (on Travis CI) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krvajalmiguelangel/libnumerica.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krvajalmiguelangel/libnumerica)
## What is this
Libnumerica is a numeric library written in C++. It includes implementations for the most common methods used in numerical computing. 
We put our effort on clarity of the code and expressive implementation of the algorithms. 
## How to use it
In order to use it you must link your project with the libnumerica static library and make  the headers accesibles in your include path so they can be visibles by your source code.
A sample project using CMake is included that shows a typical configuration to use the library.
